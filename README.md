Description: A small scenario of the player stuck in a jail cell, with the objective to escape using just your voice. The guard is powered by ChatGPT, with an "anger value" that goes up when ChatGPT determines your words as 'insulting'. The guard also can reply back to you, giving unpredictable unique voicelines to the things you say. The game has simple sword fighting mechanics, with animation blend trees added. 

ChatGPT requires an API key with money, so this concept will not be cheap unless a free version exists.
